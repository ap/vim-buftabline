1. Intro                                                      *buftabline-intro*

This plugin takes over the 'tabline' and renders the buffer list in it instead
of a tab list. It is designed with the ideal that it should Just Work: drop it
into your setup and you're done. There is only minimal configurable behavior.


==============================================================================
2. Configuration settings                                    *buftabline-config*

Changes to any of the plugin's configuration settings at runtime will not take
effect immediately unless you force an update: >
    :call buftabline#update(0)
<

*g:buftabline_show*          number (default 2)

    The value of this option specifies when the line with buffer labels will
    be displayed:
             0: never
             1: only if there are at least two buffers
             2: always
    This is analogous to the 'showtabline' setting, only for the |buftabline|.


*g:buftabline_numbers*       number (default 0)

    The value of this option specifies how to number the buffer labels:
             0: no numbering
             1: buffer number
             2: ordinal number
    The buffer number corresponds to Vim's internal buffer number as shown by
    the |:ls| command, whereas the ordinal number is a simple sequential count
    from left to right.


*g:buftabline_indicators*    boolean (default off)

    When on, the buffer's state is indicated in the buffer label. Currently
    the only state indicated is whether the buffer is 'modified'.


*g:buftabline_separators*    boolean (default off)

    When on, a vertical line is drawn inbetween tabs. (This is not strictly
    correct. The effect is actually achieved by replacing the space on the
    left side of each tab with U+23B8 LEFT VERTICAL BOX LINE. Therefore the
    separator will be highlighted the same way as the tab to its left.)

3. Mappings                                                *buftabline-mappings*

To switch buffers by their ordinal number (|g:buftabline_numbers| = 2) you can
map keys to the |<Plug>| mappings provided by this plugin: >
        nmap <leader>1 <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(1)
        nmap <leader>2 <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(2)
        nmap <leader>3 <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(3)
        nmap <leader>4 <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(4)
        nmap <leader>5 <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(5)
        nmap <leader>6 <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(6)
        nmap <leader>7 <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(7)
        nmap <leader>8 <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(8)
        nmap <leader>9 <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(9)
        nmap <leader>0 <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(10)
<
On Mac OS, you probably want to use a |<D-| mapping instead, which will emulate
the standard Cmd+1, Cmd+2, etc. keybindings for this feature: >
        nmap <D-1> <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(1)
        nmap <D-2> <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(2)
        nmap <D-3> <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(3)
        nmap <D-4> <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(4)
        nmap <D-5> <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(5)
        nmap <D-6> <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(6)
        nmap <D-7> <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(7)
        nmap <D-8> <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(8)
        nmap <D-9> <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(9)
        nmap <D-0> <Plug>BufTabLine.Go(10)
<

4. Tab coloring and colorscheme support                      *buftabline-colors*

This plugin uses several custom highlight groups to render the buffer tabs.
The custom groups are linked to several other built-in Vim highlight groups
that should provide a sensible default which automatically harmonizes with
your |colorscheme|.

However, if you dislike your colorscheme's chosen tabline colours, you can
override the default links in your |vimrc| -- c.f. |:hi-link|.

Or if you are a colorscheme designer (|44.1|), you can add support to your
colorscheme for this plugin specifically.

The highlight groups and their default links are as follows:

    Custom group             Default link      Meaning
    *BufTabLineCurrent*        |TabLineSel|        Buffer shown in current window
    *BufTabLineActive*         |PmenuSel|          Buffer shown in other window
    *BufTabLineHidden*         |TabLine|           Buffer not currently visible
    *BufTabLineFill*           |TabLineFill|       Empty area
